# Pig Game
Welcome to the Infamous Pig game.

## Description
The Pig game is a very simple jeopardy dice game in which two players race to reach 100 points. Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player holds and scores the sum of the rolls (i.e. the turn total).

## Challenges 
At any time during a player's turn, the player is faced with two decisions:

If the player rolls a 1: the player scores nothing and it becomes the opponent's turn.
If the player rolls 2 to 6: the number is added to the player's turn total and the player's turn continues.

hold - The turn total is added to the player's score and it becomes the opponent's turn.
